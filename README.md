# Hey!

This is my attempt at AOC for 2024. 

Going in, I wasn't sure what to expect, and my early attempts are pretty wild. You can see me sober up in realtime as the questions get harder, and I start having to actually debug and test my code.

As I'm writing this, I still have 10 days remaining, which I assume are going to relatively difficult, so I'll see how I go - No promises, but I hope to finish within the month of Jan.

I've learned plenty during this process, and I look forward to a cleaner attempt next year!
